Event Registration System (Cloud-Based College Project)
A serverless-inspired web application for seamless student event registrations.
Built using Flask (Python), HTML/CSS, and MySQL, this project demonstrates full-stack development along with cloud deployment concepts.

Objectives
Develop a web-based event registration system
Store and manage student data using a database
Provide a clean and user-friendly interface
Design a cloud-ready and scalable architecture

# System Architecture
Flow:
User → Frontend (HTML/CSS Form) → Flask Backend → MySQL Database → Data Display

# ☁️ Cloud Integration (Google Cloud Ready)
This project is designed to be easily migrated to cloud platforms.

# Google Cloud Integration
1️⃣ Google Cloud Run (Backend Deployment)
A serverless platform to deploy containerized Flask applications.
It automatically scales based on incoming traffic and removes the need for manual server management.

2️⃣ Google Cloud SQL (Database Service)
A fully managed MySQL database service that provides secure, reliable, and scalable data storage.
It can replace the local MySQL database used in this project.

3️⃣ Cloud-Based Architecture Benefits
High scalability and availability
Remote access from anywhere
Reduced infrastructure management
Pay-as-you-use cost model
